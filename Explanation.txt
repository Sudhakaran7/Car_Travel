the limit is 3, so first two elements in the weight of people array 1+2=3 which is the first ride,
and then the third person has weight 3 so he have to go for the second ride.
so tota number of rides is 2

Sample input:
5 3 6 2 1

The limit is 4, so the least two elements below the limit is 2,1 so 2+1=3, that is the first ride.
then array will be [5,3,6] each weights cannot be summed because it will go beyond the limit, so each weight ajith have
to ride seperately, so the ouput is 4
